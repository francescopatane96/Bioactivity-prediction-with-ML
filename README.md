# Bioactivity-prediction-with-ML
Create a bioactivity prediction app using molecular descriptors (PADEL) and supervised machine learning (ML).

modules must be used consequently, in order:
- bioprediction_part1: search data for a specific target on Chembl database and make a dataframe, collect IC50 and SMILES values and calculate molecular descriptors by PADEL. Set descriptors as x and pIC50 as y.
- bioprediction_part2: Compare various ML models and find the best one to utilize for our project.
- bioprediction_part3: Perform linear regression with RandomForest regressor, generate the model (pkl).
